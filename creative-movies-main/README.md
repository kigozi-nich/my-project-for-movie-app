## API Documentation

See `API_DOCUMENTATION.md` for details about the TMDb endpoints used, environment configuration, authentication/session flow, watchlist sync, and examples for both the React and vanilla JS versions.

For the local vanilla demo, see `vanilla/config.example.js` (copy to `vanilla/config.js` and add your API key). For the React app, use `.env` with `VITE_TMDB_API_KEY` (see `.env.example`).
